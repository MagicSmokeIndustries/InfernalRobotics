	manufacturer = Magic Smoke Industries
	description = Sometimes a foot is needed but there is not a whole lot of space to put one. That's why MSI developed the Fold, a foldable foot that is designed to work with the Foldatron family of robotics parts! Note that unlike the other Supporter feet, this does not contain any suspension, so be gentle if landing with it. It does include a light though!
