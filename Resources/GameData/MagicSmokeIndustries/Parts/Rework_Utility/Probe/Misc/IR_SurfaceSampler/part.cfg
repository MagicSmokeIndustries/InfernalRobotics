	description = This science part allows you to take surface samples from planetary bodies and asteroids without the need for a Kerbal! To take a sample the part must be placed very close to a surface for its drill to operate, so mounting it on a robot arm is recommended. It also includes a light for night time operations. Note that it uses the same Artificial Intelligence as the Observer to analyse samples, so expect equally whitty comments about what's collected.
